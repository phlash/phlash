### Hi folks!

You can find out little more about me personally on my [own blog site](https://www.ashbysoft.com/articles/phlash), for those interested in my technical background, I wrote an [introduction post on dev.to](https://dev.to/phlash/hi-im-phil-ashby) that has some historical details. I hang out on the Fediverse, find me <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.me.uk/@phlash">on Mastodon</a>..

These days I help with a few open source projects, like [SoapySDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR), [Openscenegraph](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph) and [Backscrub](https://github.com/floe/backscrub) mostly here on Github plus I do too many experiments with some sillier ideas (like getting DOOM to run on a hacker camp badge) :grin:

If you like what I do and want to buy me a beer or two, please feel free to [PaypalMe](https://paypal.me/PhlashBeers), thanks!

Phlash.
